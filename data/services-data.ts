      "I specialize in building complete, production-ready web applications using the most reliable and modern technologies, including React, Next.js, Node.js, TypeScript, and MongoDB. From setting up the frontend architecture to building powerful backend services and integrating third-party APIs, I ensure a seamless, performant, and scalable user experience. My approach includes industry-standard practices like modular codebases, reusable components, state management with tools like Redux or Zustand, SEO optimization, server-side rendering, and RESTful or GraphQL APIs. I don’t just build — I future-proof, optimize, and maintain.",

Whether using SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL) or NoSQL (MongoDB, Firebase), I provide schema design, data modeling, indexing strategies, and real-time data sync setups. I also implement complex queries, normalization, denormalization (when needed), transactional workflows, and backup mechanisms. For analytics, I can integrate with tools like BigQuery, Firebase Analytics, or build custom dashboards. My goal is simple: fast, reliable, and secure data operations.",
